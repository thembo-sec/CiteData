# CiteData
Started working on a program to parse references when endnote libraries are exported as xml files.

xmlCite.py includes the citation class which will pull data out of any individual xml citation fed to it.
This class only needs the raw xml parsed, similar to https://komax.github.io/blog/text/python/xml/parsing_tei_xml_python/

I'll populate this eventually.
